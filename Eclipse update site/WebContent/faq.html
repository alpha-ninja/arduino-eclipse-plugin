				First of all ask yourself: "Do I have something of interest to share with Jantje? I mean interesting for Jantje, not for you?" Consider this: Jantje has spent many days working on this plugin. Jantje is still spending way to much time on improving the plugin. Jantje gives it to you all for free. The only thing Jantje asks in return is that when you have a problem/question:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>look for yourself and when you really need Jantjes advice</li>
				<li>you at least have the decency to write a proper mail.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				So don't be surprised when Jantje is not responding nicely when you ask a question you should not have asked him in the first place. If you think I'm blunt; you should see the one-liner mails I get. I'm not the only person in the world who feels like this. So before sending a mail; learn something and read the

			<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">eclipse guidance when formulating your question</a> note the eclipse link is not a link to a help desk. it is a link to a document explaining how to ask questions the smart way.

				So unless you want to send a mail saying "thank you" or "well done" Consider following alternatives:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Use the arduino forum to ask questions. There are 2 threads which have been going for a while and contain lots of info. I actively monitor these threads.
					<a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,79595.0.html">Please post in this one</a> and <a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,70547.0.html">Please do not post in this one</a>.

				</li>
				<li>
					If you think you have found a bug you can log the bug at <a href="https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin">github</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want to support/bribe Jantje; <a href="donate.html">Buy him an Arduino.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				If all of the above are not appropriate then you want to discuss something in private with Jantje, which -you think- is really interesting to Jantje: you may reach him at <a href="mailto:eclipse@baeyens.it">eclipse@baeyens.it</a>.

			<h3>I use AVRECLIPSE...</h3>
			<a href="#AVRECLIPSE" name="AVRECLIPSE"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				Great, excellent choice, a neat tool. This plugin uses WinAVR. The code from WinAVR has been forked and included in V1 of this plugin. To avoid conflict between this plugin and WINAVR I had to change all the internal ID's of AVRECLIPSE. As a user you should not notice this unless you want to swap bewteen WINAVR projects and arduino eclipse projects created with this plugin.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may wonder whether it was a good idea to fork. Wouldn't it have been better to build on top like the plugin builds on top of CDT who builds on top of Eclipse.
			</p>
			<p>
				I fully agree that this would have been better. New releases of WinAVR could have been applied without hassle.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was the original idea but due to circumstances (there is no one to blame) it worked out differently.
			</p>
			<p>
				My plugin adds amongst others: the create arduino sketch, the add library, a preference page, a property page and a sample sketch to start from and the Arduino reset.
			</p>
			<p>
				So basically when you installed this tool you have the AVRECLIPSE on your system. But what is the difference between WINAVR plugin and the WinAVR included in this plugin?
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>As mentioned above I had to change all the ID's.</li>
				<li>The AVRECLIPSE tool works with external tools like GCC and AVRDude. So does the Arduino IDE.When you set the option "use Arduino IDE tools in Eclipse" you actually set all the AVRECLIPSE settings to point to the Arduino tools. As all these tools are installed underneath the Arduino folder the plugin knows their location.</li>
				<li>I fixed some bugs. Each time a tool gets used in a different way some bugs will pop up. I fixed the ones that bothered me.</li>
				<li>I added the Arduino reset (still needed for the mega)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				So unless I made a mistake and (as long as there is no newer WinAVR version) you can use only my plugin to do project development on non-Arduino and Arduino in the same environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that as I only changed the ID's and not the names installing WinAVR next to my plugin works but has the drawback that menu items will appear twice and you can't tell them from each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				V2 removed AVRECLIPSE because due is no longer a AVR. The benefits of using AVRECLIPSE no longer outweighed the drawbacks of having to support SAM. This is actually very good news for people who need the full AVRECLIPSE functionality as now you can run both at the same time without drawbacks.

			<h3>How come this plugin is free?</h3>
			<a href="#FreePlugin" name="FreePlugin"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				I have written this tool for myself for several reasons.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I lost plenty of time configuring the WinAVR plugin. As the configuration is per workspace I wanted something better.</li>
				<li>
					I trully believe the Arduino needs a software development growth path. Currently there is little available that would be a valid free software development growth path for the arduino.</li>
				<li>
					I had some time and wanted to learn more in depth about the eclipse environment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As I build it and I did not feel like investing time to make money out of it I published the code in open source.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I build the serial monitor I considered to make a commercial package from it. I decided not to do so because the price/support effort seemed out of balance at that time.
			</p>
			<p>
				In July 2012 I added a page to allow people to sponsor this project. Results have been below expectations.

				During this period my web stats reports a minimum per month of 3289 visits; 5206 page views. <a href="donate.html">Buy Jantje an Arduino.</a> 
			</p>
			<p>
				During the whole of the 3 first months I received 5 donnations.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm not complaining but I'm looking for a way to convince myself to keep new versions of the plugin available and free. And it is getting harder and harder to convince myself.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main reason is that there are plenty of people around who think: "Because Jantje gives away the code for free; he is my personal slave." In other words: I have to solve their problems and I am really rude if I refuse to do so. The result is that I spend time solving other peoples their problems or spend time getting rid of those people. In both cases my projects -for which I designed the plugin- are on hold.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the non money front: the CDT bug for which I asked to vote has <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=372807">6 votes after 19 months.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Today my Karma at the Arduino forum is 38.
				Bottom line: Due to lack of return I feel I only lose time and money with this pugin.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't want to think about this, because if I do I quit on the spot.
			</p>
			<p>
				......(Jantje stopped thinking)
			</p>
			<p>
				Update: The Arduino team has provided me with plenty of real Arduinos. I'm really pleased they have made those boards available to me. Mostly because I consider it as a recognition to my work by the core Arduino team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update 2: Some people jumped in with the development. Some hard to fix (for me) issues are now fixed for me too.
			</p>
			<p>
				*I mean free and not free for 3 years.

		<h2>Arduino IDE Versus the arduino plugin</h2>
		<div class="collapsible">
			
			<h3>Why would I want to use this plugin</h3>
			<a href="#why" name="why"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				This plugin is not meant to replace the Arduino IDE. I think the Arduino IDE is the place to get started with Arduino, no matter what is your background. However when you are growing in writing code, or when you come from a software development background you will feel restrained by the Arduino IDE. In that case the eclipse plugin may be an alternative. Advantages the eclipse environment has to the Arduino IDE are described in the next paragraphs.

			<h3>What is the benefit of the Arduino IDE to the eclipse plugin</h3>
			<a href="#benefitIDE" name="benefitIDE"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				The Arduino IDE does a great job in introducing people to Arduino. This is so for hardware people writing their first C++ code and for software developers doing their first electronics experience. So if you are new to Arduino stop reading and learn to use the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE does this by "hiding" C++ code complexity and Hardware complexity. The hardware complexity is hidden in the libraries/compiler/winAVR which are also used by the eclipse plugin. So there is no "real" difference there. The plugin does not hide the C++ code complexity. For someone used to develop C/C++ this will not be a problem. People not used to writing C++ will need to learn about
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Function declarations</li>
				<li>Using Include files</li>
				<li>The usage of extern</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This because the way the Arduino IDE is set up it hides or avoids the need of these functionalities. There are plenty of good C/C++ documents on the web that explain these things, so I won't.

			<h3>What is the benefit of the eclipse plugin to the Arduino IDE?</h3>
			<a href="#benefitArduino" name="benefitArduino"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				With the eclipse plugin you have a environment that is fully focused on the development of source code. It provides plenty of features. The ones I like the most are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>context sensitive coloring (read the color of the text changes because it is code or non active code or comment or ..)</li>
				<li>Immediate documentation (When you hover over a function you get the documentation of the function or even the implementation)</li>
				<li>Link through (ctrl clicking on a method sends you to the implementation of definition of the method)</li>
				<li>Auto complete (pressing CTRL space when typing a name you get a list of known names that start with these letters)</li>
				<li>Integration with version control tools.</li>
				<li>Search functionality like "Call hierarchy", include browser.</li>
				<li>Access to code in Arduino libraries and private libraries as if they are part of the same project.</li>
				<li>Not all files of the project need to be open all the time.</li>
				<li>Easy location of errors and warnings in the open file. (read and orange boxes right of the editor)</li>
				<li>Easy location of variables and methods in files. (gray boxes right of the editor)</li>
				<li>A system to keep hold of your Tasks. (simply adding a comment that starts with TODO will add the todo to the task view )</li>
				<li>......</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Did I mention compilation speed?
			</p>
			<p>
				So there are plenty of good things a software developer misses in the Arduino IDE.

			<h3>What do I need to know to develop code for Arduino with this plugin?</h3>
			<a href="#develop" name="develop"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				After you have read the pro and con's question you may wonder "how much is there to learn before I get this plugin to work?"
			</p>
			<p>
				There is good news and there is bad news. The good news is: Other people got it to work relatively quickly so why would you not be able to do it. The eclipse plugin (just like the Arduino IDE) hides AVR-C++ and avrDude
			</p>
			<p>
				The bad news is that to get the full benefit you will have to understand more of C/C++ development; eclipse and CDT. Eclipse is a professional development environment and that brings some complexity. But you don't have to understand it all before you get your first programs running.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		<div class="collapsible">
			<h3>In V2 there are 2 locations where I can set configuration info. Where Should I set it?</h3>
			<a href="#2Locations" name="2Locations"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				As explained above; this plugin is build on top of the WINAVR and CDT plugins. The plugin sets the "default arduino settings" and groups all arduino settings in one place. So when you change a arduino setting; the plugin sets the CDT and WinAVR setting accordingly. The settings are only set when you set them (in other words they are not verified and corrected afterwards.) This means you can change them directly using the WINAVR and CDT functionality or indirectly using my plugin settings pages. One nice example to demonstrate this is in the preference page (windows-&gt;preference-&gt;arduino-&gt;arduino). This page contains the flag "use arduino ide tools in eclipse". If you set this flag the WINAVR plugin settings will be filled with the locations of the Arduino IDE (compiler/avr dude...). But you can still go to these settings in the WINAVR pages and change them.Your changes will be in efffect even though the flag "use arduino ide tools in eclipse" is set. By removing the flag and resetting the flag you can undo the changes you did.

				I hope this is clear.

			<p>
				Yes you can and should. 
			</p>
			<p><a href="https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/">I use Rational team concert.</a> The best version control system available at this time. You can download 10 free licences (What I'm doing). If you are running an open source project you can get all the free licences you need.

		<h2>General usage Advice</h2>
		<div class="collapsible">
			
			<h3>Do you advice to use 32 or 64 bit eclipse?</h3>
			<a href="#32or64Bit" name="32or64Bit"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				Use 32 bit. No doubth. Why? The benefit of 64 is when you need more than 3Gig of memory to run the eclipse environment. Unless you integrate your projects with a suite of professional tools you will never hit this limit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Arduino comes with a set of 32 bit tools. 64 bit Eclipse can not closely integrate with these tools. As a consequence "64 bit alternatives" are delivered with the plugin. However these alternatives sometimes have "side efects".
			</p>
			<p>
				See for instance RTTX library on mac and ubuntu.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also the tools are not tested by arduino in 64 bit. This explains for instance why the serial monitor does not work with Leonardo in 64 bit but it does in 32 bit.
			</p>
			<p>
				So unless you really need 64bit eclipse I strongly advice 32 bit eclipse.
			</p>
			<p>
				Update: Arduino started to support 64 bit on Linux so that may be an exception.

			<h3>Are There any restrictions to the project name?</h3>
			<a href="#ProjectNameRestrictions" name="ProjectNameRestrictions"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>

			<h3>How do you advise to use the eclipse workspaces?</h3>
			<a href="#Workspaces" name="Workspaces"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				I keep all my arduino projects in one eclipse workspace. I make sure they al compile so there are no errors in the problem view.
			</p>
			<p>
				I work this way, and I'm not sure I would advice this way of working.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would advice starting with only one workspace. You may decide not to upgrade all you projects to the latest arduino version. At that point in time you will need an extra workspace. If you end up with plenty of projects in the same workspace you may find it is easier to split the workspace.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that splitting a workspace does not involve plenty of work.

			<a href="#doesntwork" name="doesntwork"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>

				First of all, the plugin only works on a limited amount of platforms. See the faq for which versions. If you do not use any of these operating systems you are out of luck for this plugin.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, If it doesn't work with the Arduino IDE it won't work with the plugin. Can you compile in the Arduino IDE?
			</p>
			<p>
				Thirdly,there are plenty of settings that can be wrong. If it doesn''t work for you install the Arduino IDE in a new folder; install eclipse in a new folder; use a new workspace and reinstall the plugin. When doing so make sure you do not use spaces in any names.
			</p>

				At the same location press the "test serial dll" button to verify there is a vallid dll for your OS.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the RXTX dll is enabled and there is a valid rxtx dll found for your OS/eclipse combination it works on most OS's (<a href="https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin/issues/7">there is a known issue in Linux flavours</a>)

				On some linux distro's the dll used will not find any serial ports.

				To fix this add following line to your eclipse.ini after -vmargs

				When I press the "test serial dll" I get a dialog box telling me it did not find a proper dll.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is happening?
			</p>
			<p>
				When you press the button the plugin tries to load the dll delivered with the Arduino IDE. If this dll does not load it tries to load a dll delivered with the plugin. (note older versions worked the other way around)
			</p>
			<p>
				Assuming Arduino IDE is working:
			</p>
			<p>
				The Arduino dll is 32 bit so the eclipse environment you run the plugin in is not. In other words: you are probably running 64 bit eclipse and there is no 64 bit RXTX dll delivered for your os with the plugin.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would advice to try the 32 bit version of eclipse. If you are adventures you may go and look for a 64 bit RXTX dll for you OS. (If you find one please inform me and I may be able to add it to the plugin.)

			<a href="#errorLog" name="errorLog"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				It is always a good idea to find out more about the problem at hand. There are actually 3 eclipse views that can give you more feedback on the problem at hand.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The console view</li>
				<li>The problems view</li>
				<li>The errors view</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The console view gives you more information on the commands that are being run externally. That is the compiler and avr dude. The commands should be nearly 100% the same as in the arduino IDE (the order is not always relevant). Differences I am aware of are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>-D__IN_ECLIPSE__=1: that specifies you are in eclipse (I'm considering to remove this)</li>
				<li>-Wall: stating that all warnings must be shown (the arduino IDE does not show warnings)</li>
				<li>-x c++: An option I added to force *.pde and *.ino to be treated as C++ files (the latest versions of arduino do this also)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The problems view gives an overview of the code problems and is probably not what you are looking for when you are reading this.
			</p>
			<p>
				The error view gives you an overview of errors and warnings that happened in eclipse and or its plugins. To show the errors window: select Window-&gt;show view -&gt; other-&gt;select general tab-&gt;error log. Look at the plugin column to see which plugin logged the warning. I can only tell you more about the errors and warnings generated by it.baeyens.* plugins.
			</p>
			<p>
				A final and most time consuming way to find the problem is to download the code from github. You can then compile and debug the code.

			<h3>Eclipse tells me there are bugs in my code but it compiles ok.</h3>
			<a href="#bugs" name="bugs"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				Eclipse compiles your code in 2 ways. Once when you request a build (when you press on the hammer-&gt; compiler) and ones when you change code (indexer). The compiler is responsible for the build and the indexer is responsible for the continuous build.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bugs (the red animals in the code) you see in the code can be found by any of the 2. The indexer behaves weird and sometimes doesn't find declarations that it knows. In that case you have the bug icon without actually having a bug (in other words the code compiles ok but the indexer thinks it will not).
			</p>
			<p>
				My current thinking is that following actions solve the serial problem. (note I have been thinking other solutions solved the problem)
			</p>
			<p>
				Setting the preference windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;C/C++-&gt;indexer-&gt;Files to index upfront . Add arduino.h and or WProgram.h including the full path. With me it currently states "D:/arduino-1.0.1/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/Arduino.h,cstdarg, stdarg.h, stddef.h, sys/resource.h, ctime, sys/types.h, signal.h, cstdio".
			</p>
			<p>
				Following things are known to improve the Serial problem but are suspected to cause other indexer problems.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting the preference windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;C/C++-&gt;indexer-&gt;index unused headers.</li>
				<li>Setting the preference windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;C/C++-&gt;indexer-&gt;index source and header files opened in the editor.</li>
				<li>Setting the preference windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;C/C++-&gt;indexer-&gt;Files to index upfront. Add cstdio.h, arduino.h and or WProgram.h.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Do next four in this sequence
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Right click the project-&gt;index-&gt;Search for unresolved includes.</li>
				<li>Right click the project-&gt;index-&gt;Freshen all Files.</li>
				<li>Right click the project-&gt;index-&gt;Update with modified files.</li>
				<li>Right click the project-&gt;index-&gt;Rebuild.</li>

			<h3>Where is the elf file?</h3>
			<a href="#elf" name="elf"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				When you have compiled the sketch sometimes you can not see the elf file in eclipse.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a bug related to eclipse. If your project compiled fine refresh the project (press F5 when you have the project selected).
			</p>
			<p>
				Now there should e a binaries folder in the root of your project containing the elf file.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that just like in the Arduino IDE there is no reason to "see" the elf file.

				HardwareSerial.h: I am not sure what the problem is here
			</p>
			<p>
				pins_arduino.c: contains clearly warnings that can be fixed by adding a cast
			</p>
			<p>
				Print.cpp: contains a warning that can be fixed by adding a cast
			</p>
			<p>
				Tone.cpp: contains warnings because the eclipse C/C++ indexer goes weird

				Basically there is nothing to worry about, but it would be better if it were cleaned up.

			<p>
				You are entitled to modify the Arduino IDE setup. But I'm not supporting this. If you know what you have been doing and you play a bit with eclipse you will find many ways to help you to solve your problem and probably more to make it worse.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be frank: If you can change the Arduino IDE setup you are a big boy so you can deal with it, write a document about it and share it with the world. This way we all become smarter.

			<h3>The library Wire does not compile</h3>
			<a href="#wire" name="wire"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				The eclipse plugin compiles all files as C++ files the Arduino IDE dos not do so. As a consequence the twi.c is compiled ad C++ by the plugin and as C by the arduino IDE. Modifying the twi.h file to force explicit C function prototyping fixes this problem. See the 
			</p>
			<p><a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,86344.0.html">Arduino forum thread</a> on how to do this.

				From version 1.1.8 onwards this should be fixed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The wire library also contains a include library. Due to "not top quality code of the wire library" a project using the wire lbrary also needs to include the utility folder. The same problem exists for ethernet and SD libraries.
			</p>
			<p>
				From version 1.3 onwards libraries containing an utility subfolder also have the utility subfolder added to the include path.

			<h3>To work around</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=372807">bugzille CDT project</a> (You need an account -no charge) This problem should not occur in V2.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before you delete the library: Right click the library. Select "Resource configurations"-&gt;exclude from build. Select all chackboxes (normally you only have release). Select OK.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the library you want to delete will be the last entry in your project and is grayed out.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can safely delete it now.
			</p>
			<h3>To reproduce do the following:</h3>
			<p>
				Create a Arduino sketch project using the wizard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Look at the project properties. They should look like the image below.

				As you are reading this: "obviously my site is not down". The download via eclipse is standard HTTP just like this page is to the browser. If you can access this page you can download the plugin. If it doesn't work for you: "Convince yourself that you have a problem at your site you (and you alone) will need to fix it.". You can check the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Don't try to download the plugin with a browser. See the installation instructions on how to install the plugin.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sure you have followed the installation instruction <b>uncheck "group items by category"</b>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Check wether you are downloading the latestversion. Believe me many people failed because they wanted to download an old version.
				</li>
				<li>
					In eclipse: Goto windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;general-&gt;Network settings. Verify these are set OK.

				</li>
				<li>
					Check in your firewall wether java(w) is allowed to get onto the internet.

				</li>
				<li>
					Disable virus checkers and firewalls

				</li>
				<li>
					Ask a local network specialist to help you out.

			<h3>How can I find the latest version when installing?</h3>
			<a href="#Latest_Version" name="Latest_Version"><span class="fa fa-chevron-down"></span></a><a href="#-">&nbsp;</a>
			<p>
				To find the latest version when installing a eclipse plugin. In the "install new software" dialog make sure:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					only the latest version is checked
				</li>
				<li>
					Group items by category is not checked
				</li>
				<li>
					hide items that are already installed is not checked
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Below is an example of the settings. 1.2.5.5 is probably not the latest version.

				I used to use github. However I changed to Rational team concert as it fits far better with my needs. Rational Team Concert is a great tool that allows to control the code at a high and low level at the same time. To me it outruns Github by far.

			<p>
				Thanks for noticing there is quite some test work. As there are 4 eclipse versions I support and there are 4 Arduino IDE versions I support that is 16 setups. For each of these setups I compile a dummy project for al boards. In total that is more than 200 arduino sketches. There is no way I'm doing this manually.
			</p>
			<p>
				I test all setups with Rational functional tester. Due to my employer I hold a licence to this product. I can not compare Rational functional tester to other tools in the market. I know it does the work with me spending less time than doing it manually.
